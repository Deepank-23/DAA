# 📘 DAA Assignment 1– README

## 📂 Assignment Overview
This repository contains solutions for **Assignment 1** of the *Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA)* course.  
The problems focus on fundamental algorithmic concepts such as:
- Data Structures (arrays, linked lists, hashing, etc.)
- Algorithm design and analysis
- Problem-solving using C++ STL

Each solution is implemented in **C++** with emphasis on clarity, efficiency, and reproducibility.
